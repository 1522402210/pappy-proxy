The Pappy Proxy
===============

Introduction
------------

The Pappy (**P**\ roxy **A**\ ttack **P**\ roxy **P**\ rox\ **Y**) Proxy
is an intercepting proxy for performing web application security
testing. Its features are often similar, or straight up rippoffs from
`Burp Suite <https://portswigger.net/burp/>`__. However, Burp Suite is
neither open source nor a command line tool, thus making a proxy like
Pappy inevitable. The project is still in its early stages, so there are
bugs and only the bare minimum features, but it should be able to do
some cool stuff soon (I'm already using it for real work).

Contributing
------------

**I am taking any and all feature requests.** If you've used Burp and
had any inconvenience with it, tell me about it and I'll do everything
in my power to make sure Pappy doesn't have those issues. Or even
better, if you want Burp to do something that it doesn't already, let me
know so that I can [STRIKEOUT:use it to stomp them into the dust]
improve my project.

If you're brave and want to try and contribute code, please let me know.
Right now the codebase is kind of rough and I have refactored it a few
times already, but I would be more than happy to find a stable part of
the codebase that you can contribute to.

How to Use It
=============

Installation
------------

Pappy supports OS X and Linux (sorry Windows). Installation requires
``pip`` or some other command that can handle a ``setup.py`` with
requirements. Once the requirements are installed, you can check that it
installed correctly by running ``pappy -l`` to start the proxy.

::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/roglew/pappy-proxy.git
    $ cd pappy-proxy
    $ pip install .

Quickstart
----------

Pappy projects take up an entire directory. Any generated scripts,
exported responses, etc. will be placed in the current directory so it's
good to give your project a directory of its own. To start a project, do
something like:

::

    $ mkdir test_project
    $ cd test_project 
    $ pappy
    Copying default config to directory
    Proxy is listening on port 8000
    itsPappyTime> exit
    $ ls
    data.db      project_config.json
    $ 

And that's it! The proxy will by default be running on port 8000 and
bound to localhost (to keep the hackers out). You can modify the
port/interface in ``config.json``. You can list all your intercepted
requests with ``ls``, view a full request with ``vfq <reqid>`` or view a
full response with ``vfs <reqid>``. Right now, the only command to
delete requests is ``filter_prune`` which deletes all the requests that
aren't in the current context (look at the sections on the
context/filter strings for more information on that).

Lite Mode
---------

If you don't want to dirty up a directory, you can run Pappy in "lite"
mode. Pappy will use the default configuration settings and will create
a temporary data file in ``/tmp`` to use. When you quit, the file will
be deleted. If you want to run Pappy in lite mode, run Pappy with either
``-l`` or ``--lite``.

Example:

::

    $ pappy -l
    Temporary datafile is /tmp/tmpw4mGv2
    Proxy is listening on port 8000
    itsPappyTime> quit
    Deleting temporary datafile
    $ 

Adding The CA Cert to Your Browser
----------------------------------

In order for Pappy to view data sent using HTTPS, you need to add a
generated CA cert (``certificate.crt``) to your browser. Certificates
are generated using the ``gencerts`` command and are by default stored
in ``~/.pappy/certs``. This allows Pappy to act as a CA and sign any
HTTPS certificate it wants without the browser complaining. This allows
Pappy to decrypt and modify HTTPS requests. The certificate installation
instructions are different for each browser.

Firefox
~~~~~~~

You can add the CA cert to Firefox by going to
``Preferences -> Advanced -> View Certificates -> Authorities -> Import``
and selecting the ``certificate.crt`` file in the ``certs`` directory.

Chrome
~~~~~~

You can add the CA cert to Chrome by going to
``Settings -> Show advanced settings -> HTTPS/SSL -> Manage Certificates -> Authorities -> Import``
and selecting the ``certificate.crt`` file in the ``certs`` directory.

Safari
~~~~~~

For Safari (on macs, obviously), you need to add the CA cert to your
system keychain. You can do this by double clicking on the CA cert and
following the prompts.

Internet Explorer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I didn't search too hard for instructions on this (since Pappy doesn't
support windows) and I don't own a Windows machine to try this, so if
you have trouble, I'm not the one to ask. According to Google you can
double-click the cert to install it to the system, or you can do
``Tools -> Content -> Certificates -> Trusted Root Certificates -> Import``.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration for each project is done in the ``config.json`` file. The
file is a JSON-formatted dictionary that contains settings for the
proxy. The following fields can be used to configure the proxy:

| ``{DATADIR}``   | The directory where Pappy's data files are stored   |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

See the default ``config.json`` for examples.

Generating Pappy's CA Cert
--------------------------

In order to intercept and modify requests to sites that use HTTPS, you
have to generate and install CA certs to your browser. You can do this
by running the ``gencerts`` command in Pappy. By default, certs are
stored ``~/.pappy/certs``. This is also the default location that Pappy
will look for certificates (unless you specify otherwise in
``config.json``.) In addition, you can give the ``gencerts`` command an
argument to have it put the generated certs in a different directory.

+------------+----------------+
| Command    | Description    |
+============+================+
| ``gencerts | Generate a CA  |
|  [/path/to | cert that can  |
| /put/certs | be added to    |
| /in]``     | your browser   |
|            | to let Pappy   |
|            | decrypt HTTPS  |
|            | traffic. Also  |
|            | generates the  |
|            | private key    |
|            | for that cert  |
|            | in the same    |
|            | directory. If  |
|            | no path is     |
|            | given, the     |
|            | certs will be  |
|            | placed in the  |
|            | default        |
|            | certificate    |
|            | location.      |
|            | Overwrites any |
|            | existing       |
|            | certs.         |

Browsing Recorded Requests/Responses
------------------------------------

The following commands can be used to view requests and responses

+------------+------------+----------------+
| Command    | Aliases    | Description    |
+============+============+================+
| ``ls [a|<n | list, ls   | List requests  |

|            |            | context (see   |
|            |            | Context        |
|            |            | section). Has  |

|            |            | target path,   |
|            |            | and status     |
|            |            | code. With no  |
|            |            | arguments, it  |
|            |            | will print the |

|            |            | the current    |
|            |            | context. If    |
|            |            | you pass 'a'   |
|            |            | or 'all' as an |

You can apply tags to a request and use filters to view specific tags.
The following commands can be used to apply and remove tags to requests:

Request IDs
-----------

Request IDs are how you identify a request and every command that
involves specifying a request will take one or more request IDs. You can
see it when you run ``ls``. In addition, you can prepend an ID with
prefixes to get requests or responses associated with the request (for
example if you modified the request or its response with the
interceptor, you can get the unmangled versions.) Here are the valid
prefixes:

+-----------+----------------+
| Prefix    | Description    |
+===========+================+
| ``u``     | If the request |
|           | was mangled,   |
|           | prefixing the  |
|           | ID with ``u``  |
|           | will result in |
|           | the unmangled  |
|           | version of the |
|           | request. The   |
|           | resulting      |
|           | request will   |
|           | not have an    |
|           | associated     |
|           | response       |
|           | because it was |
|           | never          |
|           | submitted to   |
|           | the server.    |
+-----------+----------------+
| ``s``     | If the         |
|           | response was   |
|           | mangled,       |
|           | prefixing the  |
|           | request ID     |
|           | ``s`` will     |
|           | result in the  |
|           | same request   |
|           | but its        |
|           | associated     |
|           | response will  |
|           | be the         |
|           | unmangled      |
|           | version.       |
+-----------+----------------+

I know it sounds kind of unintuitive. Here are some example commands
that will hopefully make things clearer. Suppose request 1 had its
request mangled, and request 2 had its response mangled.

-  ``vfq 1`` Prints the mangled version of request 1
-  ``vfq u1`` Prints the unmangled version of request 1
-  ``rp u1`` Open the repeater with the unmangled version of request 1
-  ``vfs u1`` Throws an error because the unmangled version was never
   submitted
-  ``vfs s1`` Throws an error because the response for request 1 was
   never mangled
-  ``vfs 2`` Prints the mangled response of request 2
-  ``vfs s2`` Prints the unmangled response of request 2
-  ``vfq u2`` Throws an error because request 2's request was never
   mangled
-  ``vfs u2`` Throws an error because request 2's request was never
   mangled

Passing Multiple Request IDs to a Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some arguments can take multiple IDs for an argument. To pass multiple
IDs to a command, separate the IDs with commas **(no spaces!)**. A few
examples:

-  ``viq 1,2,u3`` View information about requests 1, 2, and the
   unmangled version of 3
-  ``gma foo 4,5,6`` Generate a macro with definitions for requests 4,
   5, and 6

Context
-------

The context is a set of filters that define which requests are
considered "active". Only requests in the current context are displayed
with ``ls``. By default, the context includes every single request that
passes through the proxy. You can limit down the current context by
applying filters. Filters apply rules such as "the response code must
equal 500" or "the host must contain google.com". Once you apply one or
more filters, only requests/responses which pass every active filter
will be a part of the current context.

Filter Strings
--------------

Filter strings define a condition that a request/response pair must pass
to be part of the context. Most filter strings have the following
format:

::

    <field> <comparer> <value>

Where ``<field>`` is some part of the request/response, ``<comparer>``
is some comparison to ``<value>``. For example, if you wanted a filter
that only matches requests to ``target.org``, you could use the
following filter string:

::

    host is target.org

    field = "host"
    comparer = "is"
    value = "target.org"

Also **if you prefix a comparer with 'n' it turns it into a negation.**
Using the previous example, the following will match any request except
for ones where the host contains ``target.org``:

::

    host nis target.org

    field = "host"
    comparer = "nis"
    value = "target.org"

For fields that are a list of key/value pairs (headers, get params, post
params, and cookies) you can use the following format:

::

    <field> <comparer1> <value1>[ <comparer2> <value2>]

This is a little more complicated. If you don't give comparer2/value2,
the filter will pass any pair where the key or the value matches
comparer1 and value1. If you do give comparer2/value2, the key must
match comparer1/value1 and the value must match comparer2/value2 For
example:

::

    Filter A:
        cookie contains Session

    Filter B:
        cookie contains Session contains 456

    Filter C:
        cookie ncontains Ultra

    Cookie: SuperSession=abc123
    Matches A and C but not B

    Cookie: UltraSession=abc123456
    Matches both A and B but not C

Scope
-----

Scope is a set of rules to define whether Pappy should mess with a
request. You define the scope by setting the context to what you want
the scope to be and running ``scope_save``. The scope is saved in the
data file and is automatically restored when using the same project
directory.

Any requests which don't match all the filters in the scope will be
passed straight to the browser and will not be caught by the interceptor
or recorded in the data file. This is useful to make sure you don't
accidentally do something like log in to your email through the proxy
and have your plaintext username/password stored.

+------------+------------+----------------+
| Command    | Aliases    | Description    |

+------------+------------+----------------+

Built-In Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pappy also includes some built in filters that you can apply. These are
things that you may want to filter by but may be too tedius to type out.
The ``fbi`` command also supports tab completion.

+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Filter          | Description                                      |

| ``not_jscss``   | Matches anything that isn't JavaScript or CSS.   |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

|            |            | current        |
|            |            | context        |
+------------+------------+----------------+

Interceptor
-----------

This feature is like Burp's proxy with "Intercept Mode" turned on,
except it's not turned on unless you explicitly turn it on. When the
proxy gets a request while in intercept mode, it lets you edit it before
forwarding it to the server. In addition, it can stop responses from the
server and let you edit them before they get forwarded to the browser.
When you run the command, you can pass ``req`` and/or ``rsp`` as
arguments to say whether you would like to intercept requests and/or
responses. Only in-scope requests/responses will be intercepted (see
Scope section).

The interceptor will use your EDITOR variable to decide which editor to
edit the request/response with. If no editor variable is set, it will
default to ``vi``.

To forward a request, edit it, save the file, then quit.

+------------+------------+----------------+
| Command    | Aliases    | Description    |
+============+============+================+
| ``ic <req, | ``intercep | Begins         |
| rsp>+``    | t``,       | interception   |
|            | ``ic``     | mode. Press    |
|            |            | enter to leave |
|            |            | interception   |
|            |            | mode and       |
|            |            | return to the  |
|            |            | command        |
|            |            | prompt. Pass   |
|            |            | in ``request`` |
|            |            | to intercept   |
|            |            | requests,      |
|            |            | ``response``   |
|            |            | to intercept   |
|            |            | responses, or  |
|            |            | both to        |
|            |            | intercept      |
|            |            | both.          |
+------------+------------+----------------+

::

    Intercept both requests and responses:
    > ic requests responses
    > ic req rsp

    Intercept just requests:
    > ic requests
    > ic req

    Intercept just responses:
    > ic responses
    > ic rsp

    Be totally useless:
    > ic

To drop a request, delete everything, save and quit.

Repeater
--------

This feature is like Burp's repeater (yes, really). You choose a request
and Pappy will open vim in a split window with your request on the left
and the original response on the right. You can make changes to the
request and then run ":RepeaterSubmitBuffer" to submit the modified
request. The response will be displayed on the right. This command is
bound to ``<leader>f`` by default, but you can bind it to something else
too in your vimrc (I think, dunno if vim will complain if the function
undefined which it will be for regular files). This command will submit
whatever buffer your cursor is in, so make sure it's in the request
buffer.

When you're done with repeater, run ":qa!" to avoid having to save
changes to nonexistent files.

+------------+------------+----------------+
| Command    | Aliases    | Description    |
+============+============+================+
| ``rp <id>` | repeater,  | Open the       |

Macros
------

Macros are Pappy's version of Burp's intruder. You can use macros to
make automated requests through the proxy and save them to the data
file. A macro file is any python script file in the current directory
that is in the form ``macro_<name>.py``. An example project directory
with macros would be:

::

    $ ls -l
    -rw-r--r-- 1 scaryhacker wheel     150 Nov 26 11:17 config.json
    -rw------- 1 scaryhacker wheel 2639872 Nov 26 17:18 data.db
    -rw-r--r-- 1 scaryhacker wheel     471 Nov 26 18:42 macro_blank.py
    -rw-r--r-- 1 scaryhacker wheel     264 Nov 26 18:49 macro_hackthensa.py
    -rw-r--r-- 1 scaryhacker wheel    1261 Nov 26 18:37 macro_testgen.py
    -rw-r--r-- 1 scaryhacker wheel     241 Nov 26 17:18 macro_test.py

In this case we have a ``blank``, ``hackthensa``, ``testgen``, and
``test`` macro. A macro script is any python script that defines a
``run_macro(args)`` function and a ``MACRO_NAME`` variable. For example,
a simple macro would be:

::

    --- macro_print.py

    MACRO_NAME = 'Print Macro'

    def run_macro(args):
        if args:
            print "Hello, %s!" % args[0]
        else:
            print "Hello, Pappy!"

You can place this macro in your project directory then load and run it
from Pappy. When a macro is run, arguments are passed from the command
line. Arguments are separated the same way as they are on the command
line, so if you want to use spaces in your argument, you have to put
quotes around it.

::

    $ pappy
    Proxy is listening on port 8000
    itsPappyTime> lma
    Loaded "<Macro Test Macro (tm/test)>"
    Loaded "<Macro Macro 6494496 (testgen)>"
    Loaded "<Macro Print Macro (print)>"
    Loaded "<Macro Hack the NSA (htnsa/hackthensa)>"
    Loaded "<Macro Macro 62449408 (blank)>"
    itsPappyTime> rma print
    Hello, Pappy!
    itsPappyTime> rma print NSA
    Hello, NSA!
    itsPappyTime> rma print Idiot Slayer
    Hello, Idiot!
    itsPappyTime> rma print "Idiot Slayer"
    Hello, Idiot Slayer!

You'll need to run ``lma`` every time you make a change to the macro in
order to reload it. In addition, any code outside of the ``run_macro``
function will be run when it the macro gets loaded.

Generating Macros From Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also generate macros that have Pappy ``Request`` objects created
with the same information as requests you've already made. For example:

::

    $ pappy
    Proxy is listening on port 8000
    itsPappyTime> ls
    ID  Verb  Host         Path               S-Code  Req Len  Rsp Len  Time  Mngl
    5   GET   vitaly.sexy  /esr1.jpg          200 OK  0        17653    --    --
    4   GET   vitaly.sexy  /netscape.gif      200 OK  0        1135     --    --
    3   GET   vitaly.sexy  /construction.gif  200 OK  0        28366    --    --
    2   GET   vitaly.sexy  /vitaly2.jpg       200 OK  0        2034003  --    --
    1   GET   vitaly.sexy  /                  200 OK  0        1201     --    --
    itsPappyTime> gma sexy 1
    Wrote script to macro_sexy.py
    itsPappyTime> quit
    $ cat macro_sexy.py
    from pappyproxy.http import Request, get_request, post_request

    MACRO_NAME = 'Macro 94664581'
    SHORT_NAME = ''

    ###########
    ## Requests

    req0 = Request((
    'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n'
    'Host: vitaly.sexy\r\n'
    'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0\r\n'
    'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\r\n'
    'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\r\n'
    'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\n'
    'Connection: keep-alive\r\n'
    'Pragma: no-cache\r\n'
    'Cache-Control: no-cache\r\n'
    '\r\n'
    ))


    def run_macro(args):
        # Example:
        # req = req0.copy() # Copy req0
        # req.submit() # Submit the request to get a response
        # print req.response.raw_headers # print the response headers
        # req.save() # save the request to the data file
        # or copy req0 into a loop and use string substitution to automate requests
        pass

If you enter in a value for ``SHORT_NAME``, you can use it as a shortcut
to run that macro. So if in a macro you set ``SHORT_NAME='tm'`` you can
run it by running ``itsPappyTime> rma tm``.

Request Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main method of interacting with the proxy is through ``Request``
objects. You can submit a request with ``req.sumbit()`` and save it to
the data file with ``req.save()``. The objects also have attributes
which can be used to modify the request in a high-level way.
Unfortunately, I haven't gotten around to writing full docs on the API
and it's still changing every once in a while so I apologize if I pull
the carpet out from underneath you.

Dict-like objects are represented with a custom class called a
``RepeatableDict``. I haven't gotten around to writing docs on it yet,
so just interact with it like a dict and don't be surprised if it's
missing some methods you would expect a dict to have.

Here is a quick list of attributes that you can use with ``Request``
objects:

Like I said, these interfaces are prone to change and will probably
crash when you use them. If you get a traceback, send me an email so I
can fix it.

Intercepting Macros
-------------------

Intercepting macros let you mangle requests as they pass through the
proxy. Similarly to normal macros, an intercepting macro is any python
script with an "int" prefix. For example, ``int_name.py`` would be a
valid intercepting macro name. They are also loaded with the ``lma``
command. An intercepting macro can define two functions:
``mangle_request`` or ``mangle_response``. Both requests only take a
``Request`` object as a parameter. ``mangle_request`` returns either a
new, modified Request object to change it, or it can return the original
object to not mangle it. The ``mange_response`` must return a
``Response`` (not request!) object. The request passed in to
``mangle_response`` will have an associated response with it. If you
want to modify the response, copy ``request.response``, make
modifications, then return it. If you would like to pass it through
untouched, just return ``request.response``.

Note, that due to twisted funkyness, *you cannot save requests from
intercepting macros*. Technically you **can**, but to do that you'll
have to define ``async_mangle_request`` (or response) instead of
``mangle_request`` (or response) then use ``Request.async_deep_save``
which generates a deferred, then generate a deferred from
``async_mangle_requests`` (inline callbacks work too). If you've never
used twisted before, please don't try. Twisted is hard. Plus the mangled
request will be saved before it is submitted anyways.

Confusing? Here are some example intercepting macros:

::

    ## int_cloud2butt.py

    import string

    MACRO_NAME = 'Cloud to Butt'

    def mangle_response(request):
        r = request.response.copy()
        r.raw_data = string.replace(r.raw_data, 'cloud', 'butt')
        r.raw_data = string.replace(r.raw_data, 'Cloud', 'Butt')
        return r

::

    ## int_donothing.py

    import string

    MACRO_NAME = 'Do Nothing'

    def mangle_request(request):
        return request

    def mangle_response(request):
        return request.response

::

    ## int_adminplz.py

    from base64 import base64encode as b64e

    MACRO_NAME = 'Admin Session'

    def mangle_request(request):
        r = request.copy()
        r.headers['Authorization'] = 'Basic %s' % b64e('Admin:Password123')
        return r

Enabling/Disabling Intercepting Macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the following commands to start/stop intercepting macros

+------------+------------+----------------+
| Command    | Aliases    | Description    |
+============+============+================+
| ``lma [dir | ``load_mac | Load macros    |
| ]``        | ros``,     | from a         |
|            | ``lma``    | directory. If  |
|            |            | ``dir`` is not |
|            |            | given, use the |
|            |            | current        |
|            |            | directory (the |
|            |            | project        |
|            |            | directory)     |
+------------+------------+----------------+

|            | ``rim``    | macro.         |
|            |            | Similarly to   |
|            |            | normal macros  |
|            |            | you can use    |
|            |            | the name,      |
|            |            | short name, or |
|            |            | file name of   |
|            |            | the macro.     |
+------------+------------+----------------+
| ``sim <mac | ``stop_int | Stop an        |

Logging
-------

You can watch in real-time what requests are going through the proxy.
Verbosisty defaults to 1 which just states when connections are
made/lost and some information on what is happening. If verbosity is set
to 3, it includes all the data which is sent through the proxy and
processed. It will print the raw response from the server, what it
decodes it to, etc. Even if you don't run this command, all the
information is stored in the dubug directory (the directory is cleared
every start though!)

+------------+----------------+
| Command    | Description    |
+============+================+
| ``log [ver | View the log   |
| bosity]``  | at the given   |
|            | verbosity.     |
|            | Default        |
|            | verbosity is 1 |
|            | which just     |
|            | shows          |
|            | connections    |
|            | being          |
|            | made/lost and  |
|            | some other     |
|            | info,          |
|            | verbosity 3    |
|            | shows full     |
|            | requests/respo |
|            | nses           |
|            | as they pass   |
|            | through and    |
|            | are processed  |
|            | by the proxy   |

Additional Commands
-------------------

This is a list of other random stuff you can do that isn't categorized
under anything else. These are mostly commands that I found that I
needed while doing a test and just added. They likely don't do a ton of
error checking.

| Command    | Aliases    | Description    |
+============+============+================+
| ``dump_res | ``dump_res | Dumps the data |
| ponse <req | ponse``    | from the       |
| id> [filen |            | response to    |
| ame]``     |            | the given      |
|            |            | filename       |
|            |            | (useful for    |
|            |            | images, .swf,  |
|            |            | etc). If no    |
|            |            | filename is    |
|            |            | given, it uses |
